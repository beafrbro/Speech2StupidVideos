# How 2 Install 4 dummies
So first, install python. I can't compile it due to my dumbass not knowing how. Just be able to somehow and fork it.
The only thing you really need to install is Speech Recognition. (and also a mic)
To do so, just run `pip install SpeechRecognition` in cmd or whatever your terminal is. Make sure you have python installed.
